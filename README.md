# getDrivers
"I installed Windows on my newly built pc and I do not have any additional PC/laptop to download the driver softwares needed. I don't have the references to the devices. I have a client/ software that can detect and download the needful drivers but, I don't have/ or know how to get the Network Adapters working. I have internet connection but obviously without network adapter drivers, its practically useless."

This is a classic problem that I have faced ,post a windows installation on a self built pc without the driver softwares.
The primary issue is if you have Network Adapter driver installed on the system, things get easy, but in order to get the correct one , we either need the exact driver software as per the Network Adapter or we need another system with interent connection to download the one. Post that, the rest of drivers can be downloaded.

Idea is to build a desktop based client, to maintain a db for almost all standard Network Adapters drivers (with the oldest possible working builds) to enable the Network Adapters, post that, we need a detection of the devices of the system and then download and install all of the needful drivers. if needed that will replace the existing Network Adapter as well. Obviously the idea fails if the person does not have the software post installation. 

One may contradict saying, when I have the internet to download the software prior installation, why can't I download the drivers that are needed by my system and get along? Well, the purpose of any software in the world is to make the task easier Imagine having to just one software and let that do the work to update the drivers that your system needs.
